### My experience through iptables, some important commands & confs

#### Variables in Bash

```
$? -> last commands exit code [127: command not found, 0: success]
$0 -> script (shell) name

```

#### sed

```
echo "i love you" | sed "s/you/me/g"
echo -e "i love you\n you love me, you " | sed "2 s/you/me/g" -> just the second line
echo -e "i love you\n you love me, you " | sed "2 s/you/me/g2" -> just the second match in the second line
```

#### awk

```

```
